# Hund Söker Hem
This is a degree project for my education as a Front End Developer at Medieinstitutet. This project aims to create a digital and interactive website for the fictional dog rescue company “Hund Söker Hem”, that allows people to easily find their shelter dog match through a matching system. 

The main purpose of this project is to create a dog rescue website with a solution that goes beyond just presenting available dogs. The solution includes encouraging better communication overall and helping people to match them with the right dogs that fits their lifestyle and preferences.

The back end is hosted at Heroku and you will find the back end application [here](https://github.com/josefinelofgren/pawpatrol-backend).
